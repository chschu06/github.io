        <h2>Competitive Analysis
        </h2>
        <h4>I started with a competitive analysis to identify who the competitors were, what were their strengths and weaknesses, and how would my app stand out in the market. The two main competitors were JustAnswer and AskanExpert.pro, after
          analysis

          I was able to analyze the following:
        </h4>
        <h3>SWOT profile</h3>
        <h4>
          Competitor's position in the market
          Competitor's core elements and competitive advantage
        </h4>
        <h4>I also researched Grubhub and Match since these apps are fundamentally similar to my app, but instead my app would focus on searching for experts. The analysis from these apps were especially effective in designing the layout,
          compatibility,
          and navigation structure.
        </h4>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Interviews
        </h2>
        <h4>After defining the pain points and the market for the app, it was time to see what potential users would say. I conducted interviews with my target audience to gather qualitative data and to identify frustrations when searching for
          career
          advice, as well as what a user would expect when using an app like Expert.
        </h4>

        <h3>Questions:
        </h3>
        <h4>1. What apps do you use on a regular basis if any?
        </h4>
        <h4>2. What do you find frustrating when using these apps?
        </h4>
        <h4>3. What concerns did you have when deciding what school/career path to choose?
        </h4>
        <h4>4. How did you address these concerns?
        </h4>
        <h4>5. Did you research the school/career beforehand? If so where did you find information?
        </h4>
        <h3>Results:
        </h3>

        <h4>These questions allowed me to get some background info about each participant. It also gave me an idea about what features they may be looking for in an app and what features I should avoid implementing.
        </h4>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Personas
        </h2>
        <h4>Now that the findings of the user interviews were analyzed the next step was to create user personas to understand the types of people who will use the app.

        <h2>Card Sorting & Sitemap
        </h2>
        <h4>For the next step I conducted a card sort on OptimalSort.com to help define the information architecture. I took the results from the card sort and created a sitemap using Realtimeboards.com to create a visual representation of how a
          user
          would navigate through the app. This sitemap also served as a guide for designing wireframes.

        <h2>Usability Testing
        </h2>
        <h4>The prototype was tested several times to determine how user-friendly the design was and to help identify flaws in the prototype. Tests were moderated in-person using the invision app to help document user's actions and behavior while
          using the app. Usability issues were identified and iterations were made to resolve these issues.
        </h4>
        <h4>For each test the participant had 3 tasks to complete:
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <h4>Create a new account
          </h4>

        <h2>Test Results
        </h2>
        <h4>Out of the three tasks participants had the most difficult time with task number 1 and 3. The participants found the sign up flow confusing, so to resolve this issue icons and descriptions were added to the input fields to avoid
          confusion
          and the hotspot was moved to the keyboard on the prototype. 
          The second issue was participants were selecting the confirm button on the scheduling page before selecting a message option. To resolve this the message options were removed from the scheduling page and were given a separate page. Once a
          user selects confirm they are directed to the message options page before their appointment is confirmed. Now users won't miss the message options when making an appointment.

        <h2>Final UI Design
        </h2>
        <h4>After integrating iOS Material Guidelines, revising accessibility, and receiving feedback from my peers I revised the design again.

        <h2>Conclusion
        </h2>
        <h4>The most important part of the process is being able to take feedback. A designer may have a lot of ideas, but they must be confirmed through usability tests by potential users before solidifying them into the design. 
          In the future I would start implementing the grid system early in the design as opposed to later to help improve the UI structure of the app. The biggest problem for me that kept reoccurring was size and spacing of elements. I will need
          to
          focus on researching this subject more, but I also believe implementing the grid system sooner will help with this as well.
          I enjoy seeing how far the app has come from the early sketches through trial and error. The Expert app has come a long way and still has plenty of room for improvement. ​​​​​​​
